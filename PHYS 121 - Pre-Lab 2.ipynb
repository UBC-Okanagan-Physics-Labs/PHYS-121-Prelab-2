But also needed is imagination to create from these hints the great generalizations—to guess at the wonderful, simple, but very strange patterns beneath them all, and then to experiment to check again whether we have made the right guess. This imagining process is so difficult that there is a division of labor in physics: there are theoretical physicists who imagine, deduce, and guess at new laws, but do not experiment; and then there are experimental physicists who experiment, imagine, deduce, and guess.\n",

The goal of Lab #2 will be to experimentally search for deviations from this approximate solution.  Precision measurements of the period $T$ will be required to convincingly find these deviations.  As you demonstrated in Lab #1, one way to increase the precision of the measurements is to conduct many repeated trials.  One of the goals of this pre-lab is to try to make some educated predictions about what you should expect to observe in Lab #2,   \n"
